        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my page. My name is Simone Maya Cunningham. 
          Named after the great Nina Simone and Maya Angelo, I guess you can say my parents have an acquired taste in names.
           At the age of ten I decided to do research on my name and found out about the great accomplishments of these two ladies.
            My horizons where broaden and my eyes were open. Maya Angelou was a poet, singer, memoirist, writer and civil rights leader. 
             Eunice Kathleen Waymon also know by her stage name Nina Simone was a song writer, American singer, musician, arranger and civil rights leader.
              Powerful right?
           After obtaining that information I felt I had no choice but to a line with the power of my name and go for my dreams. </p>
